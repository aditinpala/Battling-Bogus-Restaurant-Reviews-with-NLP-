# Unmasking-Fake-Reviews-with-MNB-and-SVM

MNB and SVM for Fake Review Detection

Students from a previous text mining class created a fake restaurant review data by writing true and fake reviews. Some were positive, and some were negative.

You are going to use the MNB and SVM algorithms to build prediction models to classify the customer reviews by (1) sentiment (positive or negative) (2) authenticity (true or fake). 

For each of the two classification tasks, try different vectorization options to build the models, and evaluate them using 5-fold cross validation method. Compare the following models’ performance. Report confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure.

****Deliverable****
(1)	Your Python script.
(2)	An executive summary (up to two pages) to describe

1. The models you have built and tested, and which one is the best for each task
2. Top 10 features for each category in each task, for each algorithm. Explain if these features make sense to you, and what they mean regarding sentiment and authenticity.

3. Each model’s performance in accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure
4. Each model’s error analysis to identify areas for improvement
5. A comparison of the difficulty in sentiment classification vs. fake review classification.
